Ever been frustrated with having only limited data to test your applications?
Wished there was a tool that could **quickly generate sample data for your database** minimal hassle?
**Me too. So I built DataSmith.**

DataSmith is a user-friendly evolution of my previous project, [DataForge](https://github.com/MZaFaRM/DataForge), designed to make database population fast and simple.

I'd love to hear any feedback or suggestions!
